## Technology Stack

## Architecture
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure:
- **Scalability**: Clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend the app.
- **Testability**: Unit and widget testing are simpler to implement.

### Diagram:
- **Model**: Manages data and logic, fetches data from APIs, and stores it in appropriate structures.
- **View**: Represents the UI (Login, Signup, Dashboard, etc.) and observes changes in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Binds data from the Model to the View and handles user interactions.

---

## State Management
We use **Provider** for state management. Provider efficiently handles the state changes across the app's screens, ensuring smooth UI updates and efficient memory usage.

### Benefits of Provider:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to integrate and manage.
- **Reactivity**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead compared to other state management solutions.
